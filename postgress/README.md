# Postagram Postgree DC

This is the install script for the Postgress DB tables. 

## Getting started

1. Ensure you have postgress running and you are connected to a new database with proper permissions
2. Execute the scripts.sql against the database to propegate the necessary tables.

## Notes

The database or a mirrored remote DB are required to run the BE server.  The backend server was created using this database structure locally, but a remote DB instance will work too.
